Where does she get her information from to knock Fox ? She proves herself to be clueless.  She's not alone. Every liberal tells everyone how terrible and slanted Fox is , yet when you ask how often they watch that channel and they boast they never do.  So how do they know ?  Without getting into Shannyn's pathetic disrespect of our president--she clearly hasn't a clue about the national media and how they are anti-Trump 24 / 7 . A recent study showed 92 percent of all national stories are anti-Trump. In the past the Dispatch ran anti-Trump front page stories 7 days a week. There is littler wonder why he considers the press dishonest--because they are. If Trump found the cure for cancer they'd blame him for doing it to save his own life. Meaningless poll numbers are low because he's knocked 24 / 7 . Moore hates Trump, Fox and conservatives.",

An absolute monarchy, like Saudi Arabia, cannot be classified as either a dictatorship nor a democracy and wouldn't fit on a continuum with those as the polar options.
